abstract = {A simple method for determining the maximum energy of a beta emitter by absorption measurements is presented. Absorbers of two different metals, e.g., aluminium and copper, are used in combination. Two readings only are required for each sample. The method is particularly suited to low activity samples. The relationship between absorption coefficient, maximum energy, counting geometry and counter characteristics is discussed.}

abstract="The Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File (ENSDF), is maintained by the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) on behalf of the international Nuclear Structure and Decay Data (NSDD) network organized under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. ENSDF provides evaluated experimental nuclear structure and decay data for basic and applied research. The activities of the NSDD network, the publication of the evaluations, and their use in different applications are described. Since 1986, the ENSDF and related numeric and bibliographic data bases have been made available for on-line access. The current status of these data bases, and future plans to improve the on-line access to their contents are discussed.",
