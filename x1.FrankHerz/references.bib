	abstract = {We present new experimental data on the highly excited levels in mercury using the laser optogalvanic detection technique in conjunction with RF discharge. The 6s np 3P0 (), 6s np 3P2 () and 6s nf 3F2 () Rydberg series have been observed via two-photon excitation from the 6s6p 3P0 intermediate level, which is collisionally populated in the discharge. The 6s nf 3F2 Rydberg series to such high n-values is reported for the first time. The first ionization potential of mercury is determined from the unperturbed 6s nf 3F2 Rydberg series as 84 184.15 ± 0.05 cm−1.}
